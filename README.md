## Planetize

Hello, and welcome to our website! We are high school students at [Santa Clara High](https://santaclara.schoolloop.com/) and part of the [49ers STEM Leadership Institute](https://svefoundation.org/49ers-stem-leadership-institute/). This is soon to be where our project for Synopsys Science Fair 2020 will be hosted, so this page is temporary.

### Themes
