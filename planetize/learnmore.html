        <p>Here at Planetize, our main goal is to encourage the users to learn about and spread awareness about climate change, the causes, and how everyone can make a difference. Our website is a platform where everyone is able to learn more about what climate change is and how humans are making an impact on it. Users can spread knowledge from the information they learn from our website to others and show how they are helping the environment using Planetize's scale. The scale is a great way for users to input what activities they do every day that makes a positive influence on our environment that is changing rapidly due to human activities. When the user inputs what they have done, the planet's health icon will move closer to good health and the user can see how much of an impact they can make if everyone works together. </p>

        <p>What is climate change and why is it so important? There is so much to learn about this topic with new information constantly being released. We encourage everyone to read our brief overview of what climate change is and explore into the topic deeper with the links we provided down below and do your own research.</p>
        <p>In short, climate change is the difference of the Earth's global climates over time due to human activities. Our doings are causing greenhouse gases such as water vapor, carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and ozone to get trapped within the Earth's atmosphere, leading to temperatures rising. With the temperatures rising, glaciers and rivers in the mountains will melt and the regions they belong in will see more landslides. The polar ice caps are also melting due to the temperature increasing, which leads to the sea level rising as well. With the sea rising, the land will be wiped away. By 2100, the sea level could increase by a meter, causing 10% of the population to be displaced. With your efforts, we hope to slow down the changes that are happening rapidly to our planet. </p>
